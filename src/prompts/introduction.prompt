As a writing assistant, I want to you write the introduction of a tech blog post about the following topic:
{topic}

I want you to follow this structure:

* Opening Statement: Introduce the main topic of the post and its significance. 
* Personal Experience: Share your personal experience with the topic and stress how it helped you
* Set the tone for the post by stating that it will be practical and focused on hands-on examples. You can Mention the absence of lengthy theoretical definitions.
* Overview: Give an overview of what the readers can expect from the post. A list is preferred to make things clear.
* Call to Action: Address the target audience and highlight the relevance of the post to them. You can mention how the post will expand their toolbox and improve their productivity.
* Closing: Conclude with an enthusiastic statement that encourages readers to dive into the content. Consider using a relevant emoji or engaging phrase to create excitement.

You also need to follow these instructions:

* Do not repeat the names of the introduction's section
* The introduction should not exceed 150 words
* Avoid long sentences and word repetitions
* Start with the introduction directly without specifying your role as a writing assistant
* Use line breaks to make the output less compact

Here's an example to get you inspired:

```
Python decorators are powerful tools that help you produce clean, reusable, and maintainable code.

Iâ€™ve long waited to learn about these abstractions and now that Iâ€™ve acquired a solid understanding, Iâ€™m writing this story as a practical guide to help you, too, grasp the concepts behind these objects.

No big intros or lengthy theoretical definitions today.

This post is rather a documented list of 12 helpful decorators I regularly use in my projects to extend my code with extra functionalities.
Weâ€™ll dive into each decorator, look at the code and play with some hands-on examples.

If youâ€™re a Python developer, this post will extend your toolbox with helpful scripts to increase your productivity and avoid code duplication.

Less talk, I suggest we jump into the code now ðŸ’».
