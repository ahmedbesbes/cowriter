As a writing assistant, I want to you write the introduction of a tech blog post about the following topic:
{topic}

I want you to follow this structure:

* Opening Statement: Introduce the main topic of the post and its significance. 
* Personal Experience: Share your personal experience with the topic and stress how it helped you
* Set the tone for the post by stating that it will be practical and focused on hands-on examples. You can Mention the absence of lengthy theoretical definitions.
* Overview: Give an overview of what the readers can expect from the post. A list is preferred to make things clear.
* Call to Action: Address the target audience and highlight the relevance of the post to them. You can mention how the post will expand their toolbox and improve their productivity.
* Closing: Conclude with an enthusiastic statement that encourages readers to dive into the content. Consider using a relevant emoji or engaging phrase to create excitement.

You also need to follow these instructions:

* Do not repeat the names of the introduction's section
* The introduction should not exceed 200 words
* The introduction must contain 3 to 5 bullet points agenda
* Avoid long sentences and word repetitions
* Start with the introduction directly without specifying your role as a writing assistant
* Use line breaks to make the output less compact

Here are three examples to get you inspired:

EXAMPLE 1:
```
You‚Äôre a data scientist and you work at a software company.

You‚Äôve just trained a model and you‚Äôre happy with it because it performs well on your local cross-validation.

Now is the time to put this model into production so that other teams within your organization can consume it and embed it in their applications.

This is a very common situation that data scientists face. It can be cumbersome and painful to manage but with the right tools, the process can go smoothly.

In this tutorial, I will present an end-to-end use case to explain the workflow of putting a model to production. This is a relatively long post so feel free to skip to the parts you‚Äôre interested in.

Here‚Äôs what we‚Äôll cover:

1. Introduction to production machine learning and APIs
2. A quick overview of FastAPI features
3. Using FastAPI and SpaCy to build an inference API
4. Packaging the API with Docker and docker-compose
5. Deploying the API to AWS EC2 and automating the process with a Github Actions CI/CD

I hope you're ready. Without further ado, let‚Äôs jump right in üöÄ.
```

EXAMPLE 2:
```
Python is a dynamically-typed programming language. This means that the interpreter performs type checking only when the code runs and the variable type is allowed to change over its lifetime.

Although Python has always remained dynamically typed and was never intended to change this direction, type hints have been introduced since PEP 484 with the goal of bringing static type checking to the code analysis.

In this article, we‚Äôll introduce type hints and go over 12 concepts that you should be familiar with when using them.

At the end of this post, you should have a global overview of type hints, what they are and when you should use them. You‚Äôll also learn how to build complex types and perform static type checking.

With that being said, let‚Äôs dive in and look at some code üíª
```

EXAMPLE 3:
```
In this post, we will guide you through the process of building a voice-based ChatGPT clone that relies on the OpenAI API and uses Wikipedia as an additional data source.

To build and deploy this app, we‚Äôll be using BentoML: a Python framework for model serving and deployment.

BentoML not only helps you build services that connect to third-party proprietary APIs. It also supercharges those services by combining them with other open-source models, resulting in complex and powerful inference graphs.

In fact, the app we‚Äôll be building will have speech-to-text and text-to-speech tasks that will be handled by separate models from the HuggingFace hub and an LLM task that will be managed by LangChain.

After testing the project locally, we will push it to BentoCloud, a platform that smoothes the process of versioning, tracking, and deploying ML services to the cloud.

By the end of this article, you should have comprehensive knowledge of building and deploying multi-model services using BentoML. You‚Äôll also learn about some of its specific features that make industrializing models easier.

Without further ado, let‚Äôs have a look üîç.
