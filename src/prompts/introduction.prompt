{topic}

I want you to follow this structure:

* Opening Statement: Introduce the main topic of the post and its significance. 
* Personal Experience: Share your personal experience with the topic and stress how it helped you
* Set the tone for the post by stating that it will be practical and focused on hands-on examples. You can Mention the absence of lengthy theoretical definitions.

Here's an example to get you inspired:

```
Youâ€™re a data scientist and you work at a software company.

Youâ€™ve just trained a model and youâ€™re happy with it because it performs well on your local cross-validation.

Now is the time to put this model into production so that other teams within your organization can consume it and embed it in their applications.

This is a very common situation that data scientists face. It can be cumbersome and painful to manage but with the right tools, the process can go smoothly.

In this tutorial, I will present an end-to-end use case to explain the workflow of putting a model to production. This is a relatively long post so feel free to skip to the parts youâ€™re interested in.

Hereâ€™s what weâ€™ll cover:

1. Introduction to production machine learning and APIs
2. A quick overview of FastAPI features
3. Using FastAPI and SpaCy to build an inference API
4. Packaging the API with Docker and docker-compose
5. Deploying the API to AWS EC2 and automating the process with a Github Actions CI/CD

I hope you're ready. Without further ado, letâ€™s jump right in ðŸš€.
